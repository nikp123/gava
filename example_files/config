[general]

# Keep the application in sync with the monitor to prevent tearing
# It's generally recommended to keep it on, as different framerates may lead to unstable frametimes
# -1 = adaptive Vsync (G-Sync. FreeSync, etc.)
# 0 = off
# 1 up to refresh rate = refresh at the refresh rate of the monitor divided by the number given
; vsync = 1

# 'autosens' will attempt to balance the sensitivity to keep the amplitude of the bars 
# within a reasonable range
; autosens = true

# 'overshoot' allows bars to overshoot (in % of display height) without initiating autosens
; overshoot = 0 

# Manual sensitivity in %. Autosens must be turned off for this to take effect.
# 200.0 means double height and so on. Accepts only non-negative values.

[window]

# Window width and height

# This option aligns the window with a certain part of the screen
# The following positions are supported:
# top_left, top, top_right, left, center, right, bottom_left,
# bottom, bottom_right and none if you don't want manual positioning
; alignment = 'none'

# Additionally we can further adjust the position if needed (in pixels)
# It moves the window the opposite direction of whats in alignment
# FXP. if alignment is set to right and x_padding is 20, 
# it will move the window left 20 pixels and so on for every direction

[x11]

# Hacks and options related to X11 and GLX output modes

# Draw directly on the root window (or wallpaper) itself
# You need to stop any form of compositing for this to even work properly
; root_window = false

# Sets the override any redirection by the host WM, that is the window cannot change
# the it's order in the window stack
# This option also disables any form of interaction with the window - same as when:
#    interacable = false
; override_redirect = false

# This allows XAVA to restart when the display settings are changed
# As this can cause constant reloading (https://github.com/nikp123/xava/issues/20)
# it is left off by default (X11 only)
; reload_on_display_configure = false

# This option lets you choose a specific monitor that XAVA should occupy
# The name of the monitor is exactly the same as that of in XRandr 
# Examples being: HDMI1, VGA-1
#
# If no value has been specified, XAVA treats the whole display area as a single
# monitor (if that makes sense :\)
; monitor_name = none


[wayland]

# Hacks and options related to the Wayland output mode

# Run the visualizer at "wallpaper"-level
# This makes sure that the visualizer stays behind every window.
# Enabling this automatically disables all of your inputs since
# it acts like a wallpaper, go figure. Use UNIX (kill code)
# signaling in order to reset or end XAVA.
#
# HOWEVER: This only works for compositors supporting zwlr_layer_shell
# version 1 or above. This mostly includes wlroots-based compositors.
# GNOME and KDE won't cut it here, I believe.
# 
# As for when this is disabled, XAVA spawns a XDG window, but a lot of
# features are missing:
#  - keyboard and mouse input
#  - window borders (be it client-side or server-side)
#  - fullscreen mode
#  - non-transparent windows (just use background_opacity instead lol)
#  - any kind of GPU acceleration
#  - window positioning logic
#  - taskbar icon
#
# Also in XDG, XAVA may crash when resizing the window due to buffer
# related issues (If this bothers you, an issue or PR would be appreciated)
; background_layer = true

# When background_layer is enabled, this options offers you to select
# which monitor XAVA should occupy (examples: eDP-1, HDMI-A-1...) 
#
# Specifying an invalid monitor would cause XAVA to fall back onto the
# last monitor available

[input]

# Audio capturing method. Possible methods are the ones listed below.
# If one doesn't work, it might not be supported by your system or it just wasn't compiled with it.
#
# All input methods uses the same config variable 'source'
# to define where it should get the audio.
#
# For pulseaudio 'source' will be the source. Default: 'auto', which uses the monitor source of the default sink
# (all pulseaudio sinks(outputs) have 'monitor' sources(inputs) associated with them).
# 
# For alsa, wasapi and portaudio 'source' will be the capture device.
# For fifo 'source' will be the path to fifo-file.
#
# In case of wasapi, specify 'loopback' to capture audio from the system or anything else 
# to capture from an input device, such as a microphone
#
# You can also specify 'list' as the source to portaudio to list all available audio devices

[output]

# By default it's the window that is recommended for your platform/OS.
# 'sdl' is for a graphical window using SDL2
# 'x11' is for a X11 window
# 'glx' is for a X11 window using OpenGL 
# 'win' is for a WIN32 window using OpenGL
# 'wayland' is for a Wayland surface (ZWLR or XDG)

[color]

# Colors can be one of seven predefined: black, blue, cyan, green, magenta, red, white, yellow.
# Or defined by hex code '#xxxxxx' (hex code must be within '').

# Under Windows it uses your system accent color
